# Youtube_DL_Frontend

This is a C# program created to simplify the Youtube-DL experience. Youtube-DL Frontend features database support, menus and ASCII art. 
1. To get started, download the 4 files and place them in the same directory as Youtube-DL.
2. Execute the .exe file and the database will be created. 
3. Finally, configure everything in the menu after you've selected a video to start with. 

(!) FFMPEG is a requirement, you can place it within the same folder as the rest of the files. 

Our main branch is finally stable, and will likely not recieve many updates in the future. Submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute or open up a discussion for feature requests.
