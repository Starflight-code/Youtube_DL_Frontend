# Youtube_DL_Frontend

This is a C# program created to simplify the Youtube-DL experience. Youtube-DL Frontend features database support, menus and ASCII art. 
1. To get started, download the 4 files included in our release or compile them from source. Place these in the same folder as Youtube-DL and FFMPEG.
2. Execute the .exe file (Youtube_DL_Frontend.exe) and the database will be created. Execute the file once again for the next step. 
3. Finally, pick out a video, place the link in the program and name it. Configure everything in the menu and these should be saved in the database for next time. 

(!) FFMPEG is a requirement, you can place it within the same folder as the rest of the files. 

Our main branch is finally stable, and will likely not recieve many updates in the future. Submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute or open up a discussion for feature requests.
