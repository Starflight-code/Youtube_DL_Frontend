# Youtube_DL_Frontend

This is a C# program created to simplify the Youtube-DL experience. Youtube-DL Frontend features database support, menus and ASCII art. To get starting, download the 4 files and place them in the same directory as Youtube-DL. Execute the .exe file and the database will be created. Finally, configure everything in the menu after you've selected a video to start with. FFMPEG is a requirement, you can it within the same folder for convenience. Our main branch is finally stable, and will likely not recieve many updates in the future. Submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute or open up a discussion for feature requests.
