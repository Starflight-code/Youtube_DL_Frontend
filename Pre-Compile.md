To use this file, you will need youtube-dl and ffmpeg. This script creates a UI frontend for youtube-dl and ffmpeg conversion.
To use the script, compile it from source using Visual Studio or a similar compiler. It requires .NET 6.0

For your own use modify the userprofile, ffmpeg(refered to as ff in the code) and directory (dir) strings. Replace these with
the paths to these files within your system. Compile this and run, everything should work out of the box from there. If not,
open an issue within the, https://github.com/Starflight-code/Youtube_DL_Frontend, Github page.
