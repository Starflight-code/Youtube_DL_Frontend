This will alter behavior, since youtube-dl would be installed 
in a directory pointed to by the path env variable. This option
should not be available in windows, as it is not the norm for users. - PATCHED, see RuntimeData.cs

Disable youtube-dl and ffmpeg file detection on Linux, due to global
youtube-dl and ffmpeg command usage not tied to in-directory files. - PATCHED

Add support for yt-dlp, which is now my go-to. It recieves (some)

Run tests on linux to ensure compatiblity with batch processing system.

Add user option to toggle between yt-dlb and youtube-dl executable.

Windows will not be tested (I will no longer be using the operating system),
issues can be opened if errors pop up on windows. If I get a VM, Windows may
be official supported and tested again.

external commands (args) and internal commands (similar to iwd).
