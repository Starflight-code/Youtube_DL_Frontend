Include platform specific data in JSON, such as detected OS.
This will alter behavior, since youtube-dl would be installed 
in a directory pointed to by the path env variable. This option
should not be available in windows, as it is not the norm for users.

Disable youtube-dl and ffmpeg file detection on Linux, due to global
youtube-dl and ffmpeg command usage not tied to in-directory files.

Add support for yt-dlp, which is now my go-to. It recieves (some)
patches faster than youtube-dl.
